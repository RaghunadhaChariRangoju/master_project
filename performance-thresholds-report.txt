KEY FAILURE SCENARIOS
-------------------
1. API Server Overload
   Threshold: 200 concurrent requests
   Impact: Severe - Users experience timeouts, failed transactions, and eventual system unavailability
   Early Indicators: Response times increasing beyond 1000ms, increased error rates above 2%
   Mitigation: Implement rate limiting, API request caching, and consider horizontal scaling

2. Client-Side Rendering Failure
   Threshold: 50 products
   Impact: High - Browser becomes unresponsive, high memory usage, potential crash on mobile devices
   Early Indicators: Page load time increases linearly with product count, scrolling becomes choppy
   Mitigation: Implement virtualization for product listings, pagination, or infinite scroll with proper cleanup

3. Checkout Process Timeout
   Threshold: 8000ms
   Impact: Critical - Abandoned carts, lost sales, and customer frustration
   Early Indicators: Increasing percentage of incomplete transactions, customer support inquiries about payment issues
   Mitigation: Implement asynchronous payment processing, clear status updates, and retry mechanisms

4. Bundle Size Threshold Exceeded
   Threshold: 2048KB
   Impact: High - Dramatically increased bounce rates, especially on mobile devices and in regions with slower internet
   Early Indicators: First Contentful Paint and Time To Interactive metrics increasing, Google PageSpeed score degrading
   Mitigation: Implement code splitting, tree shaking, lazy loading, and optimize third-party dependencies

5. Database Connection Exhaustion
   Threshold: 100 connections
   Impact: Severe - New requests queue up and eventually time out, system becomes unresponsive
   Early Indicators: Increasing query times, intermittent database errors, connection pool warnings in logs
   Mitigation: Optimize connection pooling, implement query caching, and refactor inefficient query patterns

6. Memory Leak Leading to Service Crash
   Threshold: 512MB and increasing
   Impact: Critical - Server crashes, requiring restart and potential data loss or corruption
   Early Indicators: Steadily increasing memory usage without corresponding increase in traffic, performance degradation over time
   Mitigation: Identify and fix memory leaks, implement proper resource cleanup, add memory monitoring and alerts

7. Cache Invalidation Cascade
   Threshold: N/A - Event-based scenario
   Impact: High - Temporary system slowdown, potential database overload
   Early Indicators: Spike in database queries following product updates, cache hit ratio dropping suddenly
   Mitigation: Implement staggered cache invalidation, cache warming strategies, and circuit breakers


PERFORMANCE SCALING WITH USER LOAD
--------------------------------
User Load | Response Time | CPU | Memory | Network
50 users | 300ms | 25% | 128MB | 5Mbps
100 users | 500ms | 40% | 256MB | 10Mbps
250 users | 800ms | 65% | 384MB | 25Mbps
500 users | 1500ms | 80% | 480MB | 50Mbps
1000 users | 2500ms ⚠️ | 95% ⚠️ | 550MB ⚠️ | 100Mbps ⚠️ THRESHOLD EXCEEDED - SYSTEM LIKELY TO FAIL

CRITICAL ENDPOINTS AND THEIR THRESHOLDS
-------------------------------------
1. /api/products
   Max Response Time: 500ms
   Cacheable: Yes
   Failure Impact: Medium - Product browsing degraded

2. /api/cart
   Max Response Time: 400ms
   Cacheable: No
   Failure Impact: High - Unable to modify cart

3. /api/checkout
   Max Response Time: 800ms
   Cacheable: No
   Failure Impact: Critical - Unable to complete purchases

4. /api/user/profile
   Max Response Time: 600ms
   Cacheable: No
   Failure Impact: Medium - User account features unavailable

5. /api/orders
   Max Response Time: 700ms
   Cacheable: No
   Failure Impact: Medium-High - Order history unavailable


IDENTIFIED BOTTLENECKS
--------------------
1. Database Queries: N+1 query pattern in product listing with attributes
   Threshold: 50 products with attributes
   Impact: Response time increases exponentially with product count
   Recommendation: Implement eager loading and optimize query patterns

2. Image Loading: High-resolution images not properly sized for different devices
   Threshold: 200KB per image
   Impact: Page load time increases significantly, bandwidth usage spikes
   Recommendation: Implement responsive images, proper sizing, and lazy loading

3. Client-Side Rendering: Heavy component tree re-rendering on cart updates
   Threshold: 10+ items in cart
   Impact: UI becomes sluggish, especially on mobile devices
   Recommendation: Implement memoization, optimize render cycles, consider component splitting

4. API Response Size: Overfetching data in product API responses
   Threshold: 100KB response size
   Impact: Bandwidth waste, increased parse time on client
   Recommendation: Implement GraphQL or specific endpoint variations for different use cases


KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------
1. Implement comprehensive monitoring with alerts set at 80% of threshold values
2. Conduct regular load testing to verify system performance under peak conditions
3. Add circuit breakers for critical external service dependencies
4. Implement graceful degradation for non-critical features under high load
5. Optimize image delivery using responsive images and a CDN
6. Consider server-side rendering for initial page load performance
7. Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data
